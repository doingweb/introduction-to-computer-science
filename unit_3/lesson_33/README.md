## Instructor's Notes

1. Lecture
   1. Introduce block arguments
      * Define arguments: An argument is any area in a block that accepts user input, or another block. It could be a Boolean Block or a value placed inside of a variable or block.
      * Ask students to speculate on risks of relying on variables instead of arguments
        * Variables could be changed by code other than the custom block, variable names could be changed causing errors, etc.
      * Emphasize importance of custom blocks being self-contained
        * Custom blocks should continue to function correctly independent of any other changes in the program
        * Custom blocks should work correctly anywhere in the program and not require specific setup or cleanup
      * Point out how frustrating code would be if blocks like ![](../../.gitbook/assets/move.png) required setting a variable with a specific name to work
   2. Demonstrate declaration and usage of arguments
      * Point out that arguments are very similar to script variables, except their values come outside the block
      * Explain argument types
        * Only discuss text, numbers, and Booleans
          * Other types can be mentioned, but won't be used in the course
        * Ask students to describe why restricting types is important
      * Point out that arguments are passed by value
        * Specifically, changing the value of an argument inside a custom block will typically NOT change the value at the call site
      * [Arguments example](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=brettwo&ProjectName=Lesson%203.3)
        * Basic argument in pen category
        * Pass by value example in "Variables" category
2. Activity
   * Students should complete the ["Let Me Check My Calendar"](lab_33.md) activity individually or in pairs
     * This lab consists of a series of independent custom blocks.  The blocks need not necessarily be completed in the order given, but are roughly in order of difficulty.
     * The bonus \(part 3.4\) requires implementing a fairly complex formula.
3. Debrief
   * Ask a different student to provide their solution to each part.  
   * If time allows, discuss multiple solutions to each part.
     * Emphasize differences and encourage discussion about advantages and disadvantages.
     * Point out corner cases and cases where typed arguments are particularly helpful.
       * For example, avoiding try to find out whether "bubblegum" is a leap year

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Part 3.4 is a fairly complex formula and should be a challenge for advanced students.
* Struggling students should focus on section 1. The problems in section 2 represent more complex algorithms, but not necessarily any more difficult usage of arguments.
