# Lesson 4.4: List Practice II

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time
* Perform operations combining all elements in a list
* Select defined subsets of elements in a list

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 4.4: Traversing List ](do_now_44.md)
* [Lab 4.4 handout \(Number Cruncher\)](lab_44.md) \([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%204%20Word/Lab%204.4%20Number%20Cruncher.docx)\) \([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%204%20PDF/Lab%204.4%20Number%20Cruncher.pdf)\)

## Instructor's Notes

* Review
  * Ask students to define "traversal" and outline the basic code pattern
    * You need not write actual code here, but have students mention the key points \(index variable, use index to access each item, repeat length of list, etc.\)
  * Review solutions to lab 4.3
    * Ask a student to provide their solution to each part
    * Discuss errors or flaws in each solution
    * Point out similarities between each part, emphasizing that the basic code pattern is the same each time with only the operation performed on each item changing
      * If you feel students can handle it, you can further classify various traversals \(maps, filters, folds\)
    * If necessary, provide the basic code pattern for a traversal again:

      ![simple list traversal](../../.gitbook/assets/simplelisttraversal.png)
* Activity
  * Students should complete the "Number Cruncher" lab individually
    * The operations in this lab are fairly similar to those in lab 4.3, but work with lists of numbers instead of names.  As a result, students should progress more quickly.
    * As in lab 4.3, help students realize that the basic code pattern in each part will be the same.
* Debrief
  * Ask one or two students to share their solution to each part of the lab
    * If all students seem to grasp the concept, not all parts need to be reviewed
    * If skipping some parts, be sure to review at least parts 1.1 \(a fold\), 2.1 \(a map\) and 2.2 \(a filter\)
  * Point out that the solutions from labs 4.3 and 4.4 will look quite similar, even though in lab 4.3 the lists contained names in in lab 4.4 they contained numbers
    * The traversal code pattern is the same regardless of the type of elements in the list

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Advanced students should complete both bonus parts of the lab \(1.5 and 2.3\) and then assist struggling students.
* Students who need more assistance should focus on parts 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2.  Ensure that all students are able to complete at least these three parts before concluding the lesson.
