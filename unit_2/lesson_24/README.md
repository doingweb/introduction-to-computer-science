# Lesson 2.4: Variables

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Use variables to track values throughout a program

## Materials/Preparation

## Instructor's Notes

1. Lecture
   1. Review user input, specifically the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/answer.png) block
      * Ask students to speculate about how the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/answer.png) block works
        * Students should recognize that the block must be storing a value somehow and remembering it for later
      * Ask students whether that type of functionality might be useful in other cases
   2. Introduce variables
      * Define and explain the concept of a variable
        * _a "place" to store a value for retrieval and use later_
      * Consider introducing variables with an interactive physical demonstration by modifying the ["The Box Variable Activity"](https://teachinglondoncomputing.org/resources/inspiring-unplugged-classroom-activities/the-box-variable-activity/) for your students.   
      * Demonstrate creating, assigning, and accessing a variable in SNAP
        * Ignore global vs. this sprite only for now
        * Point out that a variable can only hold one value at a time
          * When a new value is assigned, the old value is lost and cannot be recovered
        * Emphasize the importance of descriptive, readable names for variables
      * Show that variables are independent
        * One variable's value can be assigned to another, as in ![](../../.gitbook/assets/setvar1tovar2.png), but changing the value of `var2` later will not update the value of `var1`
2. Activity
   * Briefly demonstrate the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/random.png) block, which will be used in the lab
   * Direct students to complete [Guessing Game](lab_24.md) individually or in pairs
3. Debrief
   * Discuss and demonstrate one or more students' submissions
   * Ask students for commentary on usage and naming of variables throughout program

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Advanced students can be encouraged to implement statistics \(best score, average guesses/game, number of time each secret number chosen, etc.\)
* Struggling students can be given code that completes part 1.1, and possibly also part 1.2, to get them started
  * Students who are particularly overwhelmed should focus only on parts 1.2 and 2.2
