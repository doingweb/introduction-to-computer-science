# Do Now 2.7: Bouncing Ball

1. Open a new Snap project and change the sprite's costume to a ball.
2. Using the following blocks, write a script that continuously moves the ball across the screen and bounces the ball when it hits the edge of the screen.
   * ![if on edge, bounce](../../.gitbook/assets/ifedgebounce.png)
   * ![when Green Flag clicked ](../../.gitbook/assets/whenclicked.PNG)
   * ![move 3 steps](../../.gitbook/assets/move3.PNG)
   * ![forever](../../.gitbook/assets/forever.png)
3. Add a second sprite. Add the same script from step 2 above for the new sprite.
4. What happens when you run? Explain what you observe.
