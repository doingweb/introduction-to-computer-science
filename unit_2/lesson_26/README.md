# Lesson 2.6: Combining Loops and Conditionals

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 2.6: Boolean Practice](do_now_26.md)
* [Lab 2.6 handout \(What Goes Up...\)](lab_26.md) \([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%202%20Word/Lab%202.6%20What%20Goes%20Up.docx)\) \([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%202%20PDF/Lab%202.6%20What%20Goes%20Up.pdf)\)

## Instructor's Notes

1. Review and lecture
   1. Review loops and conditionals
      * Ask students what loops do, when they are useful, and what loops exist in SNAP
        * loops cause code to execute multiple times
        * loops can help reduce redundancy and increase readability
        * SNAP contains three loops: repeat, forever, and repeat until
      * Ask students what conditionals are for and when they are useful
        * conditionals are used to execute a block of code only under certain circumstances
      * Encourage discussion about previous activities
      * Fill in understanding gaps when necessary
   2. Demonstrate combining loops and conditionals
      * Present ![](../../.gitbook/assets/repeat-until.png) and ![](../../.gitbook/assets/foreverif.png)
      * Ask students to suggest when these constructs might be useful
        * "repeat until" is useful when a loop needs to run not for a set number of iterations, but until some situation occurs
        * "forever if" is useful when code should execute _any time_ a condition is true, for the duration of the program
      * Point out that the condition in "repeat until" is a termination condition, while in "forever-if" it is a continuation condition
   3. Introduce the concept of modeling
      * _modeling: building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details_
      * Ask students to suggest systems or concepts that might need to be modeled
      * Discuss important considerations when designing and implementing a model
        * Lead students to realize that most sacrifice some amount of accuracy or realism for simplicity
2. Activity
   * Students should complete "What Goes Up..." lab individually
     * Mention that the code written in this lab will be helpful for the Platform Game project
3. Debrief

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Take care to ensure that all students have functional code by the end of the lab to avoid putting some students at a disadvantage starting the project
  * If many students struggle, consider releasing your own solution after the lab has been completed in class
  * Utilize TAs and advanced students to assist struggling studentsâ€”it is vital that all students complete this lab in advance of starting the project
* Advanced students can consider increasing the realism of their gravity model by adding acceleration and/or beginning to implement jumping
