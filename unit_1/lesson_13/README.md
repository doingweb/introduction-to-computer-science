# Lesson 1.3: Drawing Shapes

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Construct simple algorithms to draw shapes
* Convert algorithms into SNAP programs

## Materials/Preparation

* [Do Now 1.3: Drawing a Triangle](do_now_13.md) You can ask students to give instructions in plain language, pseudo code or with images.
* [Lab 1.3 handout](lab_13.md) \(Squares and Triangles and Stars, Oh My!\) \([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20Word/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.docx)\) \([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%201%20PDF/Lab%201.3%20Squares%20Triangles.pdf)\)
* [Geometry Cheat Sheet](https://www.math-salamanders.com/image-files/geometry-cheat-sheet-2-2d-shapes.gif)
* [Unit 1 Tips](https://github.com/doingweb/introduction-to-computer-science/tree/2be097d7d27009602b7796d96f71602e46923ac4/unit_1_tips.md)

## Instructor's Notes

1. Review
   * Review the categories of blocks and what each is for.
     * Put particular emphasis on Motion and Drawing, as those will be used for this assignment
   * Remind students about the iterative process of programming
     * Students may get frustrated throughout this activity; remind them that requiring multiple attempts to find the right solution is normal.
2. Activity
   * Students should complete the ["Triangles, Squares, and Stars, Oh My!"](lab_13.md) activity individually.
     * Point out that the shapes in part 2.1 are not necessarily listed from easiest to hardest, and that the scripts need not be written in the given order.
     * Here is a [Geometry Cheat Sheet](https://www.math-salamanders.com/image-files/geometry-cheat-sheet-2-2d-shapes.gif) by Math Salamanders showing various shapes and their respective angles. It can be presented to students as a reference during the activity and/or enlarged and placed at the front of the classroom for use throughout unit 2.
   * When students finish, have them turn in their project using whatever procedures you have set up.
3. Debrief
   * Have students switch seats with a nearby classmate and review each other's work
     * If one in a pair student was able to complete a program and the other was not, have the student who was successful walk his/her partner through
     * If neither student in a pair was able to complete a program, encourage them to work together to figure out what they were missing
       * Make sure course staff is available to help pairs who cannot figure out a given problem
   * Ask students to share what they learned from looking at their partner's programs
     * Point out the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem and two programs that are both correct might not look the same

## Accommodations/Differentiation

* Advanced students can attempt the five-pointed star. If students finish that shape, encourage them to try more advanced shapes.
  * Examples: Kite, smiley face, student's initials
* Struggling students can either be paired or allowed to not complete certain shapes.
* Students who have not yet taken geometry may have difficulty determining the correct angles. Point out to them that geometric understanding is not necessaryâ€”the angles can be determined using trial and error.
  * If students need more scaffolding, they can be pointed to an online resource such as [http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html](http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html)
  * If most students are not equipped to figure out the angles on their own, provide diagrams like the one of a square in part 1.1 to assist.
