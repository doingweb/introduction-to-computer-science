# Lesson 5.1: Intro to Cloning

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Explain why prototyping and clones can be useful
* Describe how complex goals can be accomplished using cloning

## Materials/Preparation

* [Unit 5 Tips](https://github.com/doingweb/introduction-to-computer-science/tree/2be097d7d27009602b7796d96f71602e46923ac4/unit_5_tips.md)
* [Lab 5.1 Handout](lab_51.md) \(Connect the Dots\) \([Download in Word](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%205%20Word/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.docx)\) \([Link to PDF](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%205%20PDF/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.pdf)\)
* If possible, create large poster-sized versions of the dot grids \(each grid is 12 x 3\).

## Instructor's Notes

1. Introduce activity
   * Inform students that they will be drawing some figures by following specific instructions
   * Emphasize that students must follow all instructions in the lab carefully
   * Throughout the activity, ask students to think about other ways they could accomplish the same goals and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
2. Activity
   * Split students into diverse groups of at least six.  If the number of students is not an exact multiple of six, create a few groups of seven and have students take turns being "active."
   * Students should follow the steps in the lab, being careful to act as a group.
     * In each part, the group will draw the letter 'C' six times, using slightly different instructions.
   * Students should, hopefully, notice that in part 3, they are able to achieve similar but not exactly the same results by all following the same instructions.  \(Though each student draws a 'C', they are not all in the same location.\)  In each part, they were able to improve the efficiency and clarity of the instructions.
3. Debrief
   * Ask each group to share their answers to the questions at the end of each part.
   * Discuss how this approach could be applied to coding.
   * Introduce the terms "prototyping" and "cloning" as \(mostly\) synonyms:
     * _prototyping: creating a single "master" entity that defines the behavior for a group of objects, then creating many copies of the prototype to duplicate the behavior_
